## abduznik's GitHub Profile

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a developer focused on a diverse range of projects, primarily centered around **utility tools, personal productivity, and software configuration**.

My work is heavily concentrated on:

* **Obsidian Plugin Development:** A significant portion of my public repositories involves creating, forking, and managing plugins for the Obsidian note-taking application (`Obsidian-Gemini-Transcribe`, `Obsidian-Reddit-Notes`, `Obsidian-WebBrowser`, etc.).
* **Python Utilities:** I develop tools for specific tasks, including instrumentation (`Instrument_Keysight_SG`), media processing (`FFMPEG-Image-To-Video`), and other system utilities (`HD2-Stratagem`, `TTS_Reader`).
* **Web Development & Sites:** Projects like `android-games-website`, `Kitzurit`, and `MyGarden` involve web technologies, site generation, and application wrappers.

My profile reflects an interest in automating tasks, enhancing personal workflows, and adapting existing software to new use cases.
