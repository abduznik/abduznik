## Welcome to my profile! You can check out my repositories I made throughout the time.
![Abduznik's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=abduznik)
Most of my repositories are scripts I, personally, needed for day to day use, programs for easier jobs and fun little niche projects, most of my work comes in Python language, but I also do sometimes script/work on C and C#, I have some repositories that are with JS and HTML, but I wouldn't consider them proper projects and I mostly vibe coded with them to make simpler and more niche projects than usual.
